This is an application that contains two pages: Orders and Products. The NavigationMenu component contains route links to the Orders and Products pages. The TopMenu component displays the real-time date and time.

In the Orders component, when a specific order is clicked, a list of products for that order appears on the right side, which can be closed. The following information is displayed for each order: Order name, the number of products in the order, Order creation dates in two formats, the order amount, which equals the sum of product prices in two currencies, and a delete order button that opens a modal window when clicked.

The Products component displays all products that can be sorted by product type. Each product contains information with its name, product type, warranty dates, prices in different currencies, and the order name.
